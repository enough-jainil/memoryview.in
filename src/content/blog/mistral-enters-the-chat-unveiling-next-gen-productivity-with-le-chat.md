## Feature Highlights

#### **Web Search with Citations**

Aimed at professionals and students, Le Chat provides real-time web search with detailed citations. This feature bridges the gap between LLM knowledge and the latest developments, ensuring accurate and current results for research and work.

#### **Canvas: Your Collaborative Ideation Hub**

Le Chat’s **Canvas** interface transforms traditional chat interactions into dynamic workspaces. Users can ideate, edit, and version drafts collaboratively. Whether it’s designing a dashboard mockup or creating a presentation, Canvas empowers users to craft and iterate directly within the AI interface.

#### **Document and Image Understanding**

Powered by **Pixtral Large**, Mistral’s latest multimodal model, Le Chat processes complex PDFs and images for detailed analysis. From summarizing long research papers to interpreting tables and formulas, this capability supports diverse professional needs.

#### **Image Generation**

With integrated models from Black Forest Labs, Le Chat enables users to generate custom images for creative projects. Whether for presentations or design tasks, this feature simplifies visual content creation.

#### **Automated Task Agents**

Le Chat Agents streamline repetitive workflows by automating tasks like summarizing meeting notes, processing invoices, or managing expense reports. These customizable agents enhance efficiency and can be shared across teams for collaborative benefits.
